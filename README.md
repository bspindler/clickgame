# ClickGame
A mysteriously complicated clicking game.  We'll use the simple thing we all know how to do in order to demonstrate a "server-less application" using a compute service (running functions) and leverage [event-driven architecture].  

# Technologies
Ã… list of technologies that we're interested in learning about:
  - Amazon Web Services, specifically Lambda, API Gateway, VPCs, DynamoDB, S3 and Cloudfront
  - Single-page web applications, specifically [EmberJS Framework]
  - Build tools, specifically [Git], [Gradle], [Jenkins], Eclipse]

# Setup

### Generate project files
